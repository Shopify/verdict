## v0.13.0

* Add optional experiment definition methods `schedule_start_timestamp` and `schedule_end_timestamp` to support limiting experiment's lifetime in a pre-determined time interval.
* Support eager loading from within a Rails app using Zeitwerk.
* Add `CookieStorage` storage backend. This backend is a distributed store for Verdict and does not support experiment timestamps. It is designed to be used with Rails applications and requires that `.cookies` be set to the `CookieJar` instance before use.

## v0.12.0

* Allow options to be passed to `Experiment#cleanup` so they can be forwarded to storage.

* Changed `Experiment#cleanup` to accept an argument of type `Verdict::Experiment`.
  Passing a `String`/`Symbol` argument is still supported, but will log a deprecation warning.

## v0.11.0

* Automatic eager loading when inside a Rails app.

## v0.10.0

* Add `Experiment#cleanup` to remove stored redis hashes.
* Fix typo in `Experiment#fetch_subject` error message.

## v0.9.0
**This version has breaking changes**

* Eagerly load experiment definitions when booting Rails, so that multi-threaded applications do not face a race-condition when populating experiments.
* Fixes deprecated `assert_equal` tests that return nil.

## v0.8.0
**This version has breaking changes**

* Experiments that have `store_unqualified` set to `false` will now have previous assignments loaded on `assign` regardless of whether or not the merchant no longer qualifies
* Here's the change in logic for `assign` based on whether or not the `store_unqualified` flag is on:

Old behaviour:

| store_unqualified                                                           | true | false |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|
| assignments for subjects that don't qualify are persisted in the database                   | yes  | no    |
| existing assignments are returned (even if subject doesn't qualify anymore) | yes  | no    |

New behaviour:

| store_unqualified                                                           | true | false |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|
| assignments for subjects that don't qualify are persisted in the database                   | yes  | no    |
| existing assignments are returned (even if subject doesn't qualify anymore) | yes  | **yes** |

## v0.7.0
**This version has breaking changes**

* Experiment can now specify multiple qualify blocks
  * `Verdict::Experiment#qualifier` has been removed in favor for `Verdict::Experiment#qualifiers`, which returns an array of procs
* Allow pass of an argument to qualify with a method name as a symbol, instead of a block

## v0.6.3

* Fix bug were Verdict.directory is overwritten
* Allow Verdict.directory to handle multiple directories (using globbing)

## v0.6.2

* Implement Verdict.clear_repository_cache, which fixes autoloading issues with Rails.
* Integrated Verdict.clear_repository_cache with our Railtie.

## v0.6.1

* Make Verdict Railtie `.freeze` the eager_load_paths it changes as Rails itself does.

## v0.6.0
**This version has breaking changes**

### Verdict::Experiment
* replaced following public methods that took a `subject_identifier` with an equivalent method which takes a `subject`

| old method                                                      | new method                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `lookup_assignment_for_identifier(subject_identifier)`          | `lookup(subject)`                        |
| `assign_manually_by_identifier(subject_identifier, group)`      | `assign_manually(subject, group)`        |
| `disqualify_manually_by_identifier(subject_identifier)`         | `disqualify_manually(subject)`           |
| `remove_subject_assignment_by_identifier(subject_identifier)`   | `remove_subject_assignment(subject)`     |
| `fetch_assignment(subject_identifier)`                          | `lookup(subject)`                        |

* Changed the following methods to take a `subject` instead of `subject_identifier`
 * `subject_assignment(subject, group, originally_created_at = nil, temporary = false)`
 * `subject_conversion(subject, goal, created_at = Time.now.utc)`

#### Improved Testability
`Verdict::Experiment#subject_qualifies?(subject, context = nil)` is now public, so it's easier to test
the qualification logic for your experiments.

### Verdict::BaseStorage
* `BaseStorage`'s public methods now take a `subject`, instead of a `subject_identifier`. They fetch the `subject_identifier` using the `Experiment#subject_identifier(subject)` method. Existing storages **will still work normally**.
* The basic `#get`,`#set`, and `#remove` methods are now protected.

### Verdict::Assignment
* `#initialize` now takes a `subject` instead of a `subject_identifier`, the new signature is `initialize(experiment, subject, group, originally_created_at, temporary = false)`

### Verdict::Conversion
* `#initialize` now takes a `subject` instead of a `subject_identifier`, the new signature is `initialize(experiment, subject, goal, created_at = Time.now.utc)`

### Rake Tasks
* In order to use the included helper Rake Tasks, you must implement `fetch_subject(subject_identifier)` in `Experiment`.

### Unsupported Ruby Versions
Support has been removed for the following Ruby versions:
- 1.9.X
- Rubinius
